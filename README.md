📌 Student Disease Prediction Using Weather Data

Predicting seasonal and event-driven disease patterns among students using machine learning models and integrated data sources.

📝 Project Overview

This project analyzes how climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed influence weekly disease trends among college students. By combining hospital visit records, weather data, and academic event timelines, the model predicts upcoming high-risk periods to support proactive campus healthcare planning.

Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, and LSTM are used to forecast disease occurrences and identify meaningful health patterns.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the relationship between weather variables and student illnesses.

Identify seasonal peaks and event-driven disease spikes.

Build predictive models to forecast weekly disease counts.

Support early planning and resource allocation for campus health centers.
