# student-disease-prediction-using-weather-data
This project predicts seasonal and event-driven disease patterns among students by combining hospital visit data with weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Using machine learning models, it analyzes trends, detects illness spikes, and forecasts high-risk periods to support proactive campus health planning.
